## Keys

- Cite sources with as much information as possible.
- Investigate the rights.
- How do rights impact how we can use the resources?
- How to copy links.
- How to copy links to images/file downloads.
- *Note:* if you find resources on a small local historical website, you may want to capture it in a web archive so it can be cited in the future ([Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/), intro [tutorial](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/webarchive/howto.html)).
