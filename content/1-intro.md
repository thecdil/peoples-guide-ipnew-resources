## Data and Spreadsheets

- Thinking about (humanities/history) data. 
- How does structured data becomes websites? 
- How does metadata impact discovery, useability, and context?

Example guide-like project: 

- [Latah County Historic Places](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahsites/)
    - [Physical map](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/latahsites/items/latahsites0093.html)
    - Current photographs
    - Historic photographs
    - Parse into data
    - Represent as spreadsheet (metadata, structured data)
