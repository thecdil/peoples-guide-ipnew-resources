## Keys

- Metadata "fields". [cb-docs metadata](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/cb-docs/docs/metadata/csv_metadata/)
- Carefully follow standards and conventions.
- Think about potential users and context of the data.
- Two Forms to submit structured data:
    - Place Narrative
        - Title, Location, State, Lat/long, Subject, Time, Description, Significance
    - Place Objects
        - Link, Category, Title, Creator, Date, Description, Significance, Source, Subject, Location, State, Lat/long
- Form --> Spreadsheets --> data --> website
- Finding Lat/Long.
    - Tip: on Google Maps, right click and select the top option which displays the lat long. It will copy to your clipboard, paste into this form! e.g. "46.72809926078878, -116.9934480111727"

## Place Narrative

Your place entry will be represented at a specific location on the Guide's map.
Your scholarship will analyze why it is significant to the history of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.
The entry is submitted via the form to provide it as structured data.

Fields: 

- Title - What is the name of your place?
- Location - What is its location?
- State - In which state does it lie?
- Lat/long - What is its latitude and longitude? Separate with a coma.
- Subject - What subjects does your place address? List 2-4, separated by semicolons. e.g. "libraries; inclusion; parades"
- Time - In the significance narrative you've written for this place, what time period do you focus on?
- Description - Write 1 paragraph describing the place (its history and environmental context).
- Significance - Write 4-5 paragraphs you've written analyzing the place and why it is significant to the history of Idaho and the Pacific Northwest.

## Place Objects

The "Place Objects" are sources which help illustrate your place entry, supporting and telling the stories you describe in your narrative.
You should aim to include:

- A map (historic, artistic, or scientific)
- 2 - 3 photographs or images, including historic and contemporary
- 1 - 2 other sources you find in your research (letters, documents, audio, etc)

Some of the fields are *optional*, which means don't fill them in if they are not applicable--however, if they do apply, they should be filled in!
Some values might be the same as the Place entry--fill them in anyway, since the item data can be viewed independently of the Place entry.

You will submit the place objects form multiple times! 
Each object gets its own submission and metadata. 

Fields:

- Link - paste the full URL to the image, document, or resource.
- Category - which type, Map, Historic Image, Contemporary Image, or Other Source.
- Title - the name of the object/resource. 
- Creator - who created the item? It could be an author, artist, or organization. Separate multiple with a semicolon. e.g. "Jane Doe; John Smith" (optional).
- Date - when was the item created or published? Give in the form yyyy-mm-dd. (optional) 
- Description - a brief account of the item. What is it? (1 sentence max) 
- Significance - how does the item relate to your place? What does it represent or illuminate? (3 sentences max)
- Source - where did the item come from? List the archives, institution, publication, or repository where you found the item. Provide the full name and a link if possible so someone else could find the original.
- Subject - What subjects does the item address? List 2-4, separated by semicolons. e.g. "libraries; inclusion; parades"
- Location - what location is represented in this item, or where was this item from?
- State - the state related to this item's location. 
- Lat/long - What is its latitude and longitude? Separate with a coma.
